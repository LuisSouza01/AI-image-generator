## ‚ö° Quick start

#### Starting the Development Server
Project AI Image Generator consists of two separate parts: the frontend client and the backend server. To start the development server, you need to start both the client and server.

#### Frontend (Client)
The frontend client is built with React and is located in the client folder. To start the frontend client, navigate to the client folder and run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

#### Backend (Server)
The backend server is built with Node.js and Express.js and is located in the server folder. To start the backend server, navigate to the server folder and run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

Once both the client and server are running, you can use the AI Image Generator web interface to generate images based on textual descriptions.
